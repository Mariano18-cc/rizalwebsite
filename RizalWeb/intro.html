            One hundred and thirty years ago, in 1890, the 28-year-old José Rizal arrived in Paris from London on 
            January 18 after spending a few days searching for books. He had just published his annotations of 
            *Morga's Sucesos de las Islas Filipinas* at a time when Paris, like London, was suffering from 
            "Die Influenza," which wreaked havoc across Europe.

            The influenza epidemic of 1889–90 was the largest 19th-century epidemic, arriving in Europe in late 
            1889. It captured widespread attention, especially in major cities like Paris and London, where 
            Rizal resided during this period.

            Similarly, today we face the COVID-19 pandemic, which has affected every sector of society. Like Rizal 
            and his contemporaries, we must adapt to the challenges of our time and embrace the "new normal."

            In this new era, blended learning has become a necessity. While not entirely new, it has gained 
            prominence, as institutions such as the University of the Philippines Open University have long used 
            this approach. In the new normal, all schools integrate blended or purely online learning methods. 
            Teachers and students alike are trained to navigate these platforms.

            Parents now play a significant role in their children's education at home. This shift emphasizes the 
            importance of collaboration between schools and families. Orientation sessions and training programs 
            for parents and guardians are crucial to help them adapt to their new responsibilities. Support from 
            local government units (LGUs), particularly in funding and resources, is also vital.
        </p>
        <p>
            During this pandemic, unity, understanding, and mutual support are essential. Let us be heroes in our 
            own ways, just as Rizal was in his time.
