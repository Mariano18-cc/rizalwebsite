        <p> One hundred and thirty years ago, in 1890, the 28-year old Jose Rizal arrived in
            Paris from London on 18 January after spending a few days there since the 6th looking for
            books. <br>He just published his Annotations of Morga's Sucesos de las Islas Filipinas at a time
            when Paris, like London, was suffering from "Die influenza" which was "wreaking havoc" in
            much of Europe. <br>The influenza epidemic of 1889–90 was the largest 19th century epidemic of
            influenza which arrived in Europe from the east in November and December of 1889.<br> It was so
            widely commented on in the press with the greatest attention in the cities of Paris and London
            where Rizal was during the period.<br>
            <br>Resembling in the time of our national hero, we are facing a pandemic
            specifically CoViD-19. <br>All sector of our country and of the world is affected in this present
            epidemic, like Rizal and those people who live in that era we need to adapt and accept the
            new normal way of life. <br>We need to live and protect our self to the deadly virus.<br>
            <br>Learning in the new normal. Blended learning is not wholly new but now became
            a trend. Like the established universities in the Philippine, such as the University of the
            Philippines Open University, have used blended learning. In the new normal, all schools will
            have blended or purely on-line courses. Training in using teaching and learning platforms will
            be available for both teachers and students.<br>
            <br>Under the new teaching-learning modes, parents play big role in the education of
            their children at home. Hence in this period of pandemic, when the parent’s role is crucial, the
            school partnerships with parents or guardians shall be strengthened. There will be more
            orientations and capacity building for parents and guardians to prepare them for their new
            role/responsibilities in the new teaching-learning process. Local government units (LGU)
            support in this undertakings, especially in the provision of funding and resources, is needed.<br>
            <br>In this period of COVID-19 pandemic, understanding, mutual support, unity, and
            bayanihan is a must. We need to be hero like Rizal in our own small way.
